# Budget Speech - 2025 

*By Anura Kumara Dissanayake, Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development*

*79th Budget Speech, 17th  February 2025, Parliament of Sri Lanka*

## Preamble 

Honourable Speaker, it is our pleasure to present the first National Budget of our Government to this House. 

The country went through its deepest and most complex socio, economic and political crisis in 2022 since independence. Although the crisis erupted in the year 2022, the underlying causes of the crisis are historical and structural. Corrupt governance, failed economic policies and irresponsible public financial management are the root causes of this crisis. As a consequence, there was breakdown of normalcy in economic activities in the country which was experienced by all sectors and social groups from businesses to households. Shortages in goods and services including fuel, electricity, essential food and medicine caused severe hardship on the people of the country, especially the women, children, disabled and the elderly people. Professionals were compelled to leave the country. People had to wait in long queues for days to access basic necessities and some died while waiting in the queues. The crisis of 2022 was not a mere economic crisis, it was a colossal failure in political administration up until that point. Even though the initial breakdown of the economy has been treated and largely contained, the economic crisis of 2022 has transformed into a humanitarian crisis affecting the poorest and the most vulnerable sections of society. 

Going beyond the economic and the social, the crisis also triggered a political shift in the country. Unbearable economic hardships led to social uprising against the corrupt rulers. People’s power forced them to step down from government. Thereafter, a temporary Government was formed which was a distortion of the political transformation remained unfulfilled as the new temporary government protected and continued to project the corrupt, waste public money and suppressed the people. Measures taken to postpone the local Government election in March 2023, shattered the expectations of the people for democracy. 

Through the Presidential election and the General election at the end of 2024 with unshaken determination, dedication and leadership, people took a progressive decision to form a new Government with a strong mandate to direct the country towards a common prosperity by transforming the economic, social and political system of the country. 

Hence, this Budget becomes historic as it lays the foundation for fulfilling those aspirations of the people for economic transformation of the country, by driving the economy towards sustainable growth and development. 

One of the challenges we faced at the outset was dispelling the wrongful picture of us created by the myths and malicious political propaganda against our economic policy and vision by those who tried to stop this triumph. We have succeeded in that. There were misconceptions that the Sri Lanka Rupee against the Dollar will rise even to LKR 400, that an era of fuel queues will return, international development partners and countries would isolate the new Government, investors will lose confidence, and that private property will be completely nationalized. Despite such negative propaganda against us, we were able to emerge successfully to stabilize the economy and build strong relationships with international partners and create confidence among investors. 

Accordingly, prices and the financial sector gradually stabilized with the benchmark annual Treasury bill rate coming down to 8.8 percent. Foreign currency reserves were at USD 6.1 billion by the end of December 2024 even after, the debt restructuring related payments of USD 570 million in December 2024, surpassing the predictions. Additionally, despite concerns over currency depreciation, the Sri Lankan Rupee has strengthened to approximately Rs. 300 per US dollar. We expect an economic growth of around 5 percent in 2025. 

From mid-2022, Sri Lanka implemented economic reforms with the support of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other international partners in order to address the crisis. These remedial measures in some cases added to the pricing, tax increases, and interest rate hikes. While we recognize the role played by the IMF Extended Fund Facility Programme (IMF-EFF) in stabilizing the economy, we are also of the view that in order to design our economic agenda achieving economic sovereignty is necessary. 

Another key point in the economy was the conclusion of the debt restructuring process in December 2024. In fact, when we came into power, the debt restructuring process was ongoing which we did not want to obstruct given the potential of destabilising the economy if such a drastic change took place. While taking this decision, we also considered the significant time already spent on the debt restructuring process and the additional costs the continuation of the process would incur. 

This process has provided substantial debt relief, significantly reducing debt servicing costs. It is imperative that the country leverages this fiscal space to strengthen external and fiscal buffers and enhance non- debt generating inflows such as export income and foreign investment and ensure long-term financial stability to facilitate the smooth resumption of debt repayments in the future. As a result, Sri Lanka's credit ratings were upgraded by leading global agencies, such have been gradually building investor confidence, fostering trade and investment opportunities, and lowering international financial transaction costs; key factors in driving economic growth. 

On the other hand, the created economic crisis continues to impact many, particularly the most vulnerable segments of society. The crisis led to a significant rise in the cost of living, with inflation rising up to 70 percent in 2022. Although inflation has since declined, price levels of many goods and services remain elevated, and income growth has not kept pace accordingly, thereby reducing living standards of the people. Especially because the fact that real wages have dropped significantly over the last couple of years it is necessary to offer a fair pay hike. Further, the Government has increased cash transfers to targeted communities and extended the beneficiary time period through the Aswesuma program and offered other targeted social benefits to provide relief to those in need. 

However, cash transfers of this nature are not a sustainable solution to eliminate the widespread poverty in the country. It is the obligation of a humane government to take care of the citizens who are unable to engage in economic activity due to various difficulties and challenges. We all know that there are Government is planning to select the most deserving people to the programme. At the same time, a sustainable solution to poverty alleviation is also necessary through enhancing opportunities for all people to engage in economic activity to their fullest potential. 

Economic growth must take place in a manner that is inclusive, where all citizens have enhanced economic opportunities, and the resultant benefits are reaped fairly by all strata of society. Growth for the sake of growth has little value to society unless it is a means to uplifting the lives of all members of society. For several decades, economic activity and economic benefits have been concentrated amongst the few. The concentration of income at a household level, with the top 20 percent of households accounting for 47 percent of household expenditure according to the latest (2019) Household Income and Expenditure Survey. Western Province accounts for 44 percent of GDP in 2023. Accordingly, what is needed going forward is for a greater democratisation of the economy, where election saw people asserting their political rights. What is necessary is for economic rights to be similarly asserted. This is the philosophy of this budget. 

This year’s budget is prepared under significant constraints. We should not forge the severity of the economic crisis that we have been through since 2022. Most default. However, we have achieved stability to a certain extent. Therefore, this budget has been prepared with a focused sense of fiscal discipline, economic vision and guidance. We are ready to give the political leadership necessary to reach the objectives of this budget. 

The Public Financial Management Act sets the key fiscal rule, which is a limit of accordance with this requirement. Therefore, we have to be cautious in the way we spend limited tax funds to ensure we get the best social return out of such spending. 

priorities, although it may not be to the fullest extent that is desired. Whilst these focus areas are different to traditional budgets, we have also allocated funds for the continuity of ongoing initiatives, whilst making adjustments to align these with our mandate. This is evident in our increased expenditure on the Aswesuma programme and other social welfare priorities. We have allocated funds for the feasible given the tight fiscal constraints. We are also committed to implementing a robust mechanism to prevent abuse of this scheme. We have allocated 4 percent from the Government towards driving economic growth. We will take measures to invigorate the SME sector, public transport, rural development, agricultural rejuvenation, local entrepreneurship, incentivise research, and remove barriers to growth and efficiency of domestic and export-oriented production. In all of these and other public expenditures, we will exercise a far greater degree of caution in terms of prioritisation, targeting, effective implementation and ensuring value for money. Therefore, the economic and social return is expected to be higher from every rupee that is spent out of the public finance. 

As we continue on this journey of economic rebuilding, fiscal space will expand. As we unlock more savings through efficiency gains, elimination of corruption and waste, better prioritisation, and better tax administration, there will be more must be patient, and collectively work with discipline and determination, and the rewards will materialise as we go forward.  

## Principles of Budget 2025 

A budget is not just a set of revenue and expenditure proposals for the upcoming and overall policy. This budget will encapsulate three main facets of the supply side of economic policy objectives; 

i.  Growth of production of industry, services and agriculture.  

ii.  Production must take place with the active engagement and participation of people.  

iii.  The benefits and gains from production must be equitably shared across society. 

objectives are; 

i.  To ensure continuous supply of essential goods and services. 

ii.  Such goods and services must be supplied at a fair and reasonable price. 

iii.  Goods and services must be of an acceptable level of quality. 

The mechanism by which these supply and demand objectives will be achieved would be a combination of the following; 

i.  Through the competitive market where supply, demand, and prices are determined through the forces of competition. 

ii.  Government must regulate  and monitor the market through regulatory bodies. 

iii.  Active Government participation in supply and demand in certain areas. 

iv.  Organizing production in certain areas. 

foundation to create an economy where all citizens are active participants, active remove the impediments for people to fulfil their economic potential. It is an injustice when a person is unable to fulfil their economic potential due to living in a remote area. It is an injustice when a person is unable to fulfil their economic potential due to a disability, due to a lack of educational opportunity, due to a lack of basic infrastructure. This is not an easy process that can be resolved overnight. It requires a great deal of effort to empower citizens to fulfill their economic potential. It is important to invest in education and training to build the required skills and capacity of the people. It is important to invest in healthcare to  ensure  people  have  the  opportunity  to fulfil  their  capabilities.  Providing infrastructure to enable people to access markets and engage with economic opportunities in Sri Lanka and overseas. The Government must ensure that that creates an uneven playing field. The proposals in this budget will begin economic  empowerment  of  the  people  of  this  country.  This  would  be  the foundation for democratisation of the Sri Lankan economy.   

digitalisation of the economy is an essential. Another critical foundation for economic advancement, but also social upliftment, and political reform, is the good governance and elimination of corruption.  Governance reforms and anti-flagship Clean Sri Lanka initiative aims to give life to this aspiration of society.  

## Medium Term Macroeconomic Direction 

Through the proposals presented in this budget, we are laying the foundation for a new paradigm in macroeconomic trajectory. We expect economic growth of over 5 percent real GDP growth over the medium term. Through our measures to  improve  supply  capacity  in  the  economy,  we  expect  price  shocks  to  be minimised,  thereby  providing  further  support  to  low  and  stable  inflation. Macroeconomic policy path will also be supportive of a stable external current account balance, putting an end to the era of large current account deficits. 

Accordingly, we expect the currency, which is based on market fundamentals, will no longer experience spells of substantial volatility.  

Growth will be facilitated by a strong export sector, where we expect exports of goods and services to reach an all-time high of close to USD 19 billion in 2025. This growth in non-debt creating inflows along with robust economic growth and a primary budget surplus of 2.3 percent of GDP will ensure Sri Lanka is well placed to meet the gradual increase in debt service payments from 2028 onwards.  

estimates.  Whilst  most  countries  that  have  undergone  a  sovereign  default experience a prolonged period of elevated poverty, we hope to see a reversal of this trend by 2025, followed by a persistent decline in poverty as the proposals in this budget take the first steps towards a comprehensive effort to empower the poorest and most vulnerable members of society.  

With sound financial management, responsible debt management, human capital investment, a robust social safety net, economic diversification, promotion of exports, improvement of investment climate, modernization of agriculture, green economy  policies,  innovation,  digitalisation,  entrepreneurship  &  startup ecosystems, Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), strengthening of anti-corruption measures, improvement of governance, and promotion of transparency, and sustainable growth strategies, we expect to better use the post-crisis opportunities to create a transformative change in the Sri Lankan economy to achieve long-term economic stability and prosperity.  

I will now present the 2025 Budget proposals to this Parliament. 

## 1. Expanding Exports of Goods and Services

Government will formulate the national export development plan (2025-2029) 

MSMES will be facilitated to tap new export markets, expand existing markets or to connect in the value chains of large-scale exporters and global value chains.  

With the view of removing limitations in access to high quality, affordable raw materials, new Tariff rates will be based on a National Tariff policy to create a simple, transparent and predictable tariff framework.    

particularly with a view to greater economic ties with ASEAN nations will be expanded through the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and other agreements.  

Enhanced focus will be placed on economic diplomacy with dedicated and more of Sri Lankan exports of goods and services.  

Sri Lankan expatriates  will be leveraged for enhanced access to overseas business networks,  commercial  opportunities,  and  commercial  collaboration  with  Sri Lankan exporters.  

Key border agencies and exporter registration will be automated and integrated through implementation of the Trade National Single Window (TNSW).    

The new Customs Law will be introduced to enhance trade facilitation and revenue collection.   

Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAs) will be expanded beyond the existing 44 DTAs with priority given to countries with high trade and investment potential.   

## 2. Investment Promotion and Facilitation

Government  will  support  expansion  of  export-oriented  investment,  sector-specific  zones,  establishing  eco-industrial  parks  which  focus  on  sustainable practices, resource management, and green technology through Public Private Partnership (PPPs) and privately run zones.  

The Government will revisit the Economic Transformation Act with appropriate revisions to suit the emerging developments.  

Government  will  lease  out  under-utilised  state-owned  land  for  productive economic activities.  

An  Investment  Protection  Bill  will  be  enacted  to  facilitate  and  protect investments.   

areas  such  as  registering  property,  ease  of  paying  taxes,  trade  facilitation, enforcement  of  contracts,  and  obtaining  credit  to  attract  foreign  direct investments  (FDI).  Measures  for  digitisation  of  public  services  will  play  an important role in enabling this objective. 

Government will introduce laws to ensure effective implementation of the one-stop-shop concept which consolidates all necessary approvals. 

Barriers  for  local  firms  to  invest  overseas  will  be  reviewed  and  gradually rationalised  by  establishing  appropriate  safeguards  to  track  repatriation  of earnings and dividends.  

A Public Private Partnership (PPP) Bill will be introduced.   

Bimsaviya programme will be expedited to develop good quality land titles for small scale land owners, which will increase the commercial usability of land.   

A new Insolvency Law, already in the draft stages, will be expedited. 

Government will call for foreign direct investments to optimize the utilization of 

Government will provide required technical and financial assistance for exporters and importers to obtain quality testing and certifications.   

The testing and calibration labs, referral centers, the referral Center for health research  on  cancerous  inputs,  Universities  and  other  conformity  assessment bodies inclusive of Industrial Technology Institute will also be developed with an effective coordination mechanism to have efficient service delivery for clients.  In order to fulfill the desired outcome of the NQI system in the country, we propose to allocate Rs.750 million for 2025. 

Sri Lanka has the potential to be a hub for trade, logistics, financial services, and the digital economy. This budget will provide the fundamental steps towards fulfilling this potential.  

Logistics holds significant potential to serve as a premier driver of economic development in Sri Lanka, leveraging the country's strategic geographic location. 

percent contribution to exports and provides direct full-time employment to an 

The completion of the East and West Container Terminal projects will have a significant  capacity  enhancement  of  the  Port  of  Colombo.  Additionally,  the proposed Colombo West Terminal 2 and Colombo North Port is expected to 

Expression of Interest for these projects within a month.  

The Port of Colombo is currently experiencing severe congestion as container volumes have surged significantly, exposing the need for critical development in infrastructure and systems and procedures. 

Therefore, we propose to allocate Rs. 500 million from the 2025 Budget to support the land acquisition process and initial preparatory works of the Kerawalapitiya custom inspection yard and Bloemendhal Logistics Park. 

As a long-term measure to ease the container traffic congestion in and around the Colombo  port  and  increasing  foreign  earning  through  value  addition,  it  is proposed to establish an Internal Container Dry Port (ICD) at Veyangoda as a rail based Integrated Multimodal Cargo and Logistic Center (IMCLC). We propose to allocate  Rs.  500  million  to  review  previous  studies,  identify  an  institutional mechanism, land acquisition and initial preparatory works on ICD at Veyangoda. 

We propose to allocate Rs. 500 million to support the initial development of the National Single Window System, Truck Appointment System, E-Cargo Tracking System and Port Community System.  

Modernizing infrastructure and incorporating cutting-edge technology is crucial for improving cargo movement. Outdated scanning systems are causing delays in the whole supply chain. Therefore, we propose to allocate Rs. 1,000 million to support  the  initial  development  and  establishments  of  advanced  scanning systems for Port of Colombo and Bandaranayake International Airport. 

## 4. Digital Economy Advancement

important pillars of our Economic Development strategy. Digital Transformation will uplift economic growth through enhancing productivity across industrial and service sectors, advancing economic opportunity, improving public service delivery and improving transparency in governance and public finance.   

Introduction of Sri Lanka Unique Digital Identification (SL-UDI) for all citizens is a  key  priority.  SL-UDI  is  a  foundational  Digital  Public  Infrastructure  (DPI) essential for the development of a digital economy. Steps have already begun towards this process and it is expected that this process will be expedited.  

Public and Institutional Trust in the Safety and Integrity of Digital Services and Systems is critical for the success and sustainability of Digital Transformation. Sri 

new legislation and the strengthening of existing legislation. We will also focus on  strengthening  the  related  institutional  framework.  We  will  enact  new Legislation to further accelerate the Digital Economy and to empower an Apex Digital Economy Authority as well as other subject specific agencies in the Digital Eco-System.  We will also strengthen legislation and institutions related to Cyber Security, Data Privacy and Data Protection.   

Digital  Economy  Framework.  The  accelerated  adoption  of  digital  payments flowing between Government, Business and Citizens will be key accelerator of the Digital Economy.  The recently launched GovPay system is an example of one such Digital Payment channel. It is necessary to gradually shift away from a cash-based economy. It would be implemented in a carefully phased process with clear communication.  

The Government will facilitate a conducive investment environment to attract Private Capital and Partnerships across all segments of the Digital Economy. This will  also  support  to  attracting  investments  towards  innovations  in  artificial intelligence, robotics, FinTech, and other emerging technologies.  

or 12 percent of the National Economy over the next 5 years. In achieving this annual export revenue to USD 5 billion. 

Accordingly, we propose to allocate Rs. 3,000 million to bolster the acceleration of Digital Economy Development through the initiatives described. 

## 5. Tourism Sector

It is necessary to ensure that we focus on the value generated from tourism instead of simply focusing on the number of arrivals. 

Towards this end, steps will be taken to develop local destinations so as to optimize  value  generation  from  each  destination  with  local  branding  of destinations to reflect the unique cultural value proposition of that destination with required infrastructure facilities. After identification, the required critical infrastructure development activities will be carried out on a priority basis during the 2 year period, 2025-2026. This infrastructure development will be supported by an integrated city branding and promotion campaign for these developed destinations. For this purpose, we propose to allocate Rs. 500 million for year 

The Government will facilitate training youth in communication and other skills, in the tourism sector.   

Developing  and  promoting  new  tourist  destinations  to  expand  the  moving capacity of tourists will be a priority agenda of the Government.  

In parallel, a digital ticketing system will be introduced to address issues of over-crowding and improve capacity of the sector.  

Bandaranaike  International  Airport  Terminal  2  will  be  expanded  with  the support of Japanese investments.  

The Government will improve tourist safety and facilities through a combination of technology based solutions linking the  tourist police, Government agencies and civic organizations to provide information on tourist attractions, receive security alerts, feedback on tourist experience and monitor complaints to law enforcement authorities.      

## 6. SMEs as the Backbone of Economic Development

The development of small and medium enterprises and entrepreneurship is a key objective of the Government. Access to finance has long been one of the biggest challenges facing the SME sector and rural entrepreneurs. The financial culture in this country has been one of collateral based lending which has led to a great deal of financial exclusion. Whilst banks must protect the interests of depositors and ensure prudence in their lending practices, there also needs to be a solution for SMEs and new entrepreneurs as well.  

Towards this end, the Government is working towards setting up a development bank.  As  a  first  step,  the  function  of  a  development  bank  through  a  new administrative  structure  will  be  established  through  the  existing  state  bank mechanism. The Government will support this task through the National Credit Guarantee Institution (NCGI).  

## 7. Fostering Innovation & Entrepreneurship

R&D  projects  will  be  aligned  with  the  industry  needs  in  collaboration  and consultation  with  diverse  stakeholders  including  research  institutions, universities, Government agencies and private sector and National Intellectual Property Organization (NIPO).  

Priority for R&D initiatives will be on following areas;  

i.  Providing co-financing for selected R&D initiatives.  

ii.  Coordinate  linkages  between  public  R&D  institutions  and  relevant 

iii.  Facilitate  exporters  to  receive  trademark  protection  globally  through 

accession to the Madrid Protocol. 

It is reported that 272 patent registrations were in 2020 and out of them, 223 patents were Non-Resident registrations and we ranked as the 61st country in 2019 in terms of patent application submission. We observe that there are a number of research findings which have not been commercialized and utilized for the benefit of the economy, and reaping the investment opportunities. For this purpose,  we  propose  to  allocate  Rs.  1,000  million  to  create  an  Innovation Invention Fund for commercialization of Research Findings. 

## 8. Expenditure Management

The Government will continue efforts to streamline state expenditure. The entire ecosystem of allowances and benefits provided to public representatives is being reviewed. Through such interventions, it would be possible to free up valuable resources that are tied up in depreciating assets and deploy them in far more productive uses.  

To  set  an  example  on  the  side  of  the  political  leadership  on  expenditure 

the Government.  

Public resources such as mansions allocated for the President, Prime Minister and Ministers have been redirected to effective public use. A Committee is appointed to recommend the best use of such properties in economically viable projects and the public interest.  

All luxury vehicles that require heavy running & maintenance expenses will be auctioned.  

Vehicles assigned as official vehicles to Government officials have high fuel consumption and are of significant value. These vehicles incur high maintenance costs. Hence, the Government has decided to minimize heavy expenditure  on  vehicles  by  encouraging  selected  officers  through  an additional financial benefit.  

Over the years, the Government mechanism has enlarged into an unwieldy structure. Several agencies have been set up without appropriate study or reason. This  has  resulted  in  duplication,  wastage,  and  a  hindrance  to  the  effective delivery of Government services. In order to remedy this situation, a Committee functions and utility of a plethora of Government agencies. It would be possible to determine which agencies need to continue, which need to be amalgamated with other agencies, and which agencies need to be discontinued, which need to change their objectives. This exercise is expected to deliver substantial gains in terms of improved efficiency in delivery of public services.   

A key requirement to reduce future financial risk emanating from SOEs is to improve SOE governance. Towards this end, a Holding Company under the full control of the Government will be established under which selected SOEs are held as subsidiaries with a view to improve governance, financial discipline and operational efficiency.       

provincial council level. In that, a monthly assistance is given for providing nutritious food especially for pregnant mother, for which Rs. 7,500 million has been earmarked. Also, for the Triposha program for the nutrition of mothers and children, Rs. 5,000 million has been allocated.  

For programs to prevent child and women violence, empower women and save women, Rs. 120 million has also been allocated. In order to maintain the network spread across the island for the implementation of programs aimed at women Rs. 720 million will be incurred.  

## 10. Towards a Healthy Society

i.  Digitalization of the Health system 

the other countries in the region. Accordingly, new initiatives and interventions will be carried out from 2025 to enhance the digitalization of healthcare delivery. This will include digitalization of functions of National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA), State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC), and improvement 

ii.  Improving Rural-level Primary Health Care  

Efforts are being made to improve the service delivery at over 1,000 Primary Medical Care Units (PMCUs) and Divisional hospitals with the focus on non-communicable  disease  control  and  prevention.  Furthermore,  palliative  and geriatric  care  services  will  be  available  at  selected  PMCUs  in  each  district, especially considering the ageing population.  

iii.  Estate Health 

Actions will be taken to expedite the process of strengthening estate level health care service through Public Private Partnership (PPP) with Regional Plantation Companies.  Required  human  resources,  necessary  equipment  and pharmaceuticals for estate hospitals will be provided by the Government. 

iv.  Pandemic Preparedness 

National capacity for pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response will be improved with the assistance of development partners over the next three years. Additionally, surveillance and early warning capacity against all potential health hazards will be strengthened. 

A healthy population is also essential for human capital development, as it directly  contributes  to  increased  productivity,  better  educational  outcomes, enhanced workforce participation, innovation and skill development. It also promotes social stability, improve quality of life, and drive economic growth and stability.  Accordingly,  Government  health  budget  for  2025  has  significantly increased to an allocation of Rs. 604,000 million. 

In order to ensure the supply of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, Rs. 185,000 million is allocated in 2025 budget. The Government will take necessary actions  through  the  Ministry  of  Health  to  ensure  the  procurement  and distribution  of  quality  pharmaceuticals  and  medical  supplies  without  any interruption and minimize wastages while optimizing procurement processes and full utilization of funds.  

v.  Provision of healthcare treatment for Children with Neurodevelopmental Disabilities, including Autism 

Sri Lanka has seen a rise in the number of children diagnosed with  neuro-developmental disabilities, including autism over the past decade. 

To  address  these  challenges,  it  is  proposed  to  implement  a  5-year  national program to improve health, education and service facilities for children with neurodevelopmental disabilities, including autism across all 25 districts of Sri Lanka. As an initial step, we propose to allocate Rs. 200 million for 2025 to establish a treatment center for children with neurodevelopmental disabilities with international standards at the Lady Ridgeway Children's Hospital (LRH). 

Further, efforts will be made to establish similar kind of treatment centers in every district with the necessary human resources within the next five years. 

vi. Inclusive  Early  Childhood  Development  for  Children  with Neurodevelopmental Disabilities, including Autism 

Currently, the Pre-schools and Day-care services are provided by the private sector. Pre-schools and Day-care facilities for children with Autism are limited. This is mainly due to the lack of awareness and capacity among preschool teachers and caregivers on inclusive education and early childhood development for  children  with  Neurodevelopmental  Disabilities,  including  Autism. Accordingly, we propose allocating  Rs. 250 million  for developing  a model daycare center.  

## 11. Education Opportunities for Everyone

Due to economic challenges that prevailed in the country, renovations of school infrastructure have not been done since 2019. Therefore, over Rs. 10,000 million has already been allocated from the 2025 budget to upgrade school infrastructure. 

Rs. 135,000 million has already been allocated to improve the quality of the university system.  

We propose to increase the payment per meal per student for pre-school morning meal programme from Rs. 60 to Rs. 100 and a provision of Rs. 1,000 million has already been made in 2025 budget estimates for this purpose. 

An allocation of Rs. 80 million has been made in the 2025 budget estimates to construct a model early childhood education center laying a foundation for lifelong learning. 

Recognizing pre- school teachers as key players in human resource development, in order to enhance the quality of preschool education and acknowledge their valuable contribution, we propose to increase their monthly allowance by Rs. 1,000 starting from June this year. Accordingly, we propose to allocate Rs. 100 million for this purpose.  

The Government's policy is to develop a primary school within 3 kilometers there are 10,126 Government schools island wide. Of them, 3,946 are primary schools, and approximately 634,094 children enrolled in these schools. There are more than 3,000 schools having fewer than 100 students, 1,471 schools have fewer than 50 students. Most of these schools are in rural and remote areas. This has led to a great disparity between schools. Accordingly, it is proposed to review the school system to prepare a national plan to relocate schools. Accordingly, we propose to allocate Rs. 500 million to implement this programme. 

a.  We propose to increase monthly scholarship amount from Rs. 750 to Rs. 1,500 to Students who qualified grade 5 scholarship examination in low-income families. Accordingly, we propose to allocate Rs. 1,000 million for this purpose. 

b.  Nutritious Food Allowance has been supported for students in sports schools to obtain a nutritious diet. Hence, we propose to double the monthly Nutritious Food Allowance from Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 10,000 per student.  Budgetary  provision  has  been  already  made  in  2025  budget estimate for this purpose. 

c.  We propose to increase this stipend from 4,000 to Rs. 5,000 per month for students in vocational Education.  Budgetary provision has already been made in 2025 budget estimate for this purpose, in addition to which we propose to allocate a further Rs. 200 million for the same. 

d.  We propose to increase monthly Mahapola scholarship from Rs. 5,000 to Rs.  7,500  and  monthly  Bursary  payments  from  4,000  to  Rs  6,500.  A provision of Rs. 4,600 million has already been made in 2025 budget estimates. 

All of these payments will be made from April, 2025. 

Universities 

We propose to create a programme to offer scholarships for students who show outstanding performance in G.C.E. A/L examination to study undergraduate degree programmes at high-ranking universities and return to Sri Lanka to apply their acquired knowledge and skills to the country. For this purpose, we propose to allocate Rs. 200 million to initiate this programme in 2025.   

In this regard, we propose to develop specialized sports schools in five provinces; Western, Northern, Central, Uva, and North Central, and the schools will be selected based on the records of the past or present students accomplished in the local and international competitions. Accordingly, we propose to allocate Rs. 500 million for the development of sports schools in five provinces.  

A large number of readers, including school students from Jaffna and nearby islands,  use  the  Jaffna  Library.  However,  the  infrastructure  has  not  been adequately developed for the benefit of these readers. Therefore, we propose to allocate Rs. 100 million from this budget to provide computers and other essential facilities for this library. In addition to that, we propose to allocate another Rs. 200 million under this budget for the development of other regional libraries. 

## 12. Energy Sector

on diversifying energy sources with more weight on renewable energy and modernizing infrastructure. Government will continue to invest in the energy sector while welcoming local and foreign investors who could provide the best tariff advantage to Sri Lanka. Necessary reforms to the regulatory framework will be prioritized to facilitate internal restructuring with the new Act to be passed soon.  

We awarded a tender to a 50MW wind power project at USD 4.65 cents for a unit of electricity. In that context, awarding projects at an excessive tariff around USD 8.26  cents  cannot  be  justified.  To  provide  energy  at  a  competitive  cost  to industries, exporters, and consumers, we will welcome energy investments based on the lowest tariffs and we will not provide preferential treatment purely on the company or the country of origin.  

 When we exclude the oil tanks given CPC and IOC,  there are 61 more oil tanks in the Trincomalee oil tank complex which has 99 tanks of 10,000 Metric Ton capacity. Considering the strategic location of these tanks, there is high potential to access international markets. We expect to develop these tanks collaborating with internationally recognized companies.  

## 13. Agriculture and Food Security

The agriculture sector provides employment to approximately 30 percent of the enhancing the potential of the agriculture sector is a key requirement in terms of improving economic opportunities for the vast majority of Sri Lankans.  

The  Government  policy  on  agriculture  sector  is  aimed  at  increasing  its productivity, competitiveness and resilience. The fertilizer subsidy for paddy farmers will be continued, for which the Government has already allocated Rs. 35,000 million for 2025. The development of quality seeds, cascade management, efficient use of water in agriculture has been identified as priority areas and are expected to be supported by the budgetary allocation. 

Maha 2024/25 is proposed to be maintained as a resilience measure to bridge the demand and supply of rice in the market while avoiding haphazard price volatility. We propose to allocate Rs. 5,000 million for this purpose for Maha system for timely decision making. Therefore, action will be taken to establish a sound data and information system covering the entire value chain from the point of production up to the point of consumption under the ongoing new  World  Bank  Project;  Integrated  Rurban  Development  and  Climate Resilience Project. 

production of green gram, black gram, chillie, red-onion, cowpea, soya, maize, potatoes and other selected cereals as well as tuber crops will be increased through an accelerated programme over the medium term 2025-2027. For this purpose, we propose to allocate Rs. 500 million for 2025, in addition to the funds given for the Ministry of Agriculture for 2025.       

It is appropriate to develop a regulatory framework to regulate the collection and storage of paddy and rice stock in the market. Accordingly, it is proposed to amend the Paddy Marketing Board Act for vesting the powers with them to regulate the collection and storage of paddy and rice.  

Some of the  lands presently managed by LRC, RPCs, SLSPC, JEDB and under utilized will be identified and brought in for private investment including SMEs taking the suitability of the land into consideration. We propose to allocate Rs. 250 million to undertake initial activities in this regard.  

At present, there are many global examples of successful producer cooperative arrangements. Fonterra a New Zealand dairy cooperative, Amul, Indian Dairy Farmers Cooperative and Mondragon Workers Cooperative of Spain are a few of the best global examples. 

We  too  propose  to  adopt  an  alternative  production  approach  where  the cooperative  mechanism.  The  Government  will  support  these  cooperative mechanisms through provision of land, agricultural extension services, and other support.  To  further  strengthen  the  legal  empowerment  and  to  provide  the necessary infrastructure facilities and financial incentives, we propose to allocate Rs. 100 million for this initiative for 2025. 

The youth entrepreneurs in agro-based SMEs, particularly for those who expect to  scale-up  or  willing  to  engage  in  startups,  will  be  targeted  through  this initiative. We propose to allocate Rs. 500 million for this purpose. 

At present, the domestic milk production is sufficient only to cater to around 45 percent of the local demand. In order to increase the dairy production, Rs. 2,500 million is proposed to be invested during 2025-26 for the improvement of Dairy Value Chains and to enhance dairy farming productivity through the ongoing Inclusive Connectivity Development Project.  

of the population living and working in the rural sector. The total public sector investment for irrigation sector development for 2025 is estimated at Rs. 78,000 million.  

The new water resources development projects, including Malwathu Oya, Gin Nilwala,  Maduru  Oya  Right  Bank  development,  Mundeni  Aru  project  will gradually be brought into implementation over the medium term, considering the priority within the available fiscal space.     

In  order  to  rehabilitate  down-stream  development  of  Galoya,  Rajanganaya, Minneriya and Hurulu Wewa schemes, an allocation of Rs. 2,000 million is proposed to be provided in 2025.  

## 14. Plantations and other export crops

The global demand for coconut products is continuously increasing, and as predicted by the industry, total nut requirement of the country would be 4,500 million nuts in 2030, where 1,800 million nuts are expected to be used for home consumption, and the balance 2,700 million nuts can be absorbed for industry purposes.  

Therefore,  we  propose  to  allocate  Rs.  500  million  for  high-yielding  coconut seedlings to the growers in the Northern region for planting 16,000 acres of new coconut  land  in  established  Northern  Coconut  Triangle  based  on  CRI recommendation.   

Measures will be taken to expand value addition in traditional exports such as Cinnamon. Marketing and promotion of these products will be enhanced through farmers in order to improve supply quality and facilitate linkage with value added exporters, including through international joint ventures.   

In order to link to the global value chain, we propose to allocate Rs. 250 million to  implement  an  integrated  product  development  and  trade  promotion programme on Ceylon cinnamon and other export crops.  

## 15. Fisheries & Aquaculture

Limited availability of freshwater prawn seeds is identified as a major constraint to further develop the freshwater prawn farming industry in Sri Lanka. In order to  promote  the  stocking  of  freshwater  prawn  in  tanks  and  non-traditional aquaculture, and enhance the future production towards export economy, we propose  to  empower  farming  community/fisheries  societies  and  local communities and establishment of freshwater prawn hatcheries under Public Private  Partnership  (PPP)  arrangements,  farmer  cooperatives  and  marketing networks and facilitate farmer societies to link with such marketing networks as well. For this purpose, we propose to allocate Rs. 200 million. 

## 16. Social Protection

Increasing  ageing  population,  low  female  labour  force  participation,  and shrinking labour market have created a challenging situation in the country. Furthermore, it is observed that inequality and vulnerability persist particularly among certain segments; including children, disadvantaged women, the elderly, to protect and to empower them to integrate into society as productive and equal partners. 

In order to ease the burden of vulnerable communities, the Government will take necessary steps to safeguard them by enhancing the cash grants for those in the social registry. Accordingly, the Government  has increased social protection programme net spending to Rs. 232.5 billion in 2025. The increase in the monthly benefit allowance paid to the two social groups; the poor and the extremely poor, from Rs. 8,500 to Rs. 10,000 and from Rs. 15,000 to Rs. 17,500, respectively, has already been implemented with effect from January 2025. We propose to extend the benefit payment period for transitional social groups whose payments were set to end on March 31, 2025, until April 30, 2025. Further, for those eligible for Aswesuma  to  enter  the  scheme,  yet  not  included  it  is  expected  to  finish enumeration in May 2025, providing another opportunity for them to enter the programme.  

We propose to increase the monthly allowances for kidney patients and people with disabilities from Rs. 7,500 to Rs. 10,000 and monthly allowances for elderly persons from Rs. 3,000 to Rs. 5,000 with effect from April 2025. 

empowered using Government funds and foreign funds. Around 25,000 families have  been  selected  to  be  empowered  under  the  pilot  programme  with  the assistance of the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank funded projects. The  remaining  number  of  potential/  eligible  families  are  expected  to  be empowered gradually using the local funds. Accordingly, we propose to enhance the empowerment programme by Rs. 500 million. 

The Government has already announced and implemented several other relief measures such as the Rs. 6,000 payment for each student from low income groups to support purchase of education related stationary and books. The Government has also already provided a kerosene subsidy amounting to a total of Rs. 3 billion during the period October 2024 up to March 2025 to support the livelihoods of the fishing community, particularly to help them withstand the lingering impacts of the economic crisis.   

Certified Schools/Remand Homes and Childcare Institutions 

At present, 379 certified schools/detention homes/children's homes are being operated. Out of these, 47 institutions are operated by the Government. The facilities in these homes are at a very low level and it is observed that security is not adequate in some places. Some buildings need repairs and the buildings in some districts do not have sufficient space. Therefore, we propose to improve the capacity  of  child  care  centers  in  the  areas  of  physical  and  human  resource development. For this purpose, we propose to allocate Rs. 500 million. 

We observe that children in institutionalized homes are most vulnerable for many reasons including due to inadequate transport facilities. Accordingly, we propose to allocate Rs. 250 million in 2025 to purchase the necessary vehicles for this purpose.       

every citizen is given the opportunity to lead a dignified and secure life, we propose social security and housing to orphaned children. This initiative will provide them with long-term support, skills development, and financial security, ensuring their well-being and integration into society as empowered individuals who can positively contribute to the economy. 

The  2025  Budget  has  presented  proposals  for  the  welfare  of  children  in Government  institutions  and  detention  homes.  When  implementing  these proposals, relevant institutions should prioritize the following matters: 

i.  A  monthly  allowance  of  Rs.  5,000  for  institutionalized  children  and orphans will be provided. We propose that Rs. 2,000 be deposited into a minor's  account,  and  the  remaining  Rs.  3,000  be  given  to  their  legal guardians under Government supervision for the children's expenses. We propose to allocate Rs. 1,000 million from the 2025 Budget for this purpose. 

ii.   Most of these children lack a family background or supportive system to help them to start their lives with housing and security. Therefore, these vulnerable communities are postponing marriage due to the inability to afford housing, which leads to social stress, and economic disparities. 

While their bank savings provide a foundation, it is often insufficient to cover the cost of building a house. Considering this reality, we propose a Rs.  1  million  housing  grant,  to  build  a  stable  and  secure  house.  To implement this, the Government proposes to allocate Rs. 1,000 million in the 2025 budget.  

iii. Ensuring  opportunities  for  children  in  care  homes  and  Government rehabilitation centers to enroll in the nearest national or Provincial Council school with proper educational facilities when providing school education. 

iv. Following rehabilitation methodologies that provide NVQ level 3 or 4 quality  vocational/skills  training  for  youth  being  rehabilitated  in rehabilitation  centers,  enabling  them  to  join  society  as  good,  and productive  citizens  with  a  profession  or  livelihood  upon  release. Developing a methodology for issuing Police/Grama Seva certificates in a way  that  doesn't  hinder  those  who  have  been  rehabilitated  and demonstrate good conduct from obtaining suitable employment. 

v.  Giving  priority  based  on  qualifications  for  Government  housing assistance, training, and employment recruitment when institutionalized children are reintegrated into society after turning 18 and when such children marry (especially for females). 

vi. Amending relevant laws to allow individuals to continue residing in these institutions under certain conditions when institutionalized children who turn 18 are not in a suitable position to reintegrate into society, with the aim of preventing their abuse and exploitation by various persons. 

A significant number of the population suffers with one or many disabilities. We observe that there is no reliable data base about their distribution, difficulties, educational level, abilities to engage in economic activities and employment. Therefore, we propose to allocate Rs 100 million to establish a comprehensive database on the people with disabilities under the Secretariat for Persons with Disabilities in collaboration with the Department of Census and Statistics in the year 2025. 

A compensation of Rs. 250,000 is currently being paid to the people who lose their lives and those who get permanently disabled due to disasters. Accordingly, actions have been taken to increase this compensation to Rs. 1,000,000 for death or permanent disabilities caused by all factors, including natural disasters and damages caused due to wildlife.  

Further,  the  payment  of  compensation  of  Rs  2.5  million  has  been  already introduced  for  property  damages  that  were  not  yet  been  compensated persons with disabilities, which are affected by disaster.  

We are experiencing many unfortunate incidents of suicides among adolescents. The Government has recognized the severity of this issue as a social problem. Therefore,  we  propose  to  allocate  Rs.  250  million  for  2025  to  implement  a medium-term programme to expand the awareness and counselling services for students and adolescents by the Ministry of Health in collaboration with the Ministry of Education. 

Assistive devices are crucial for people with disabilities and they are considered as a part of their body. I observe that a comprehensive programme is required to expand  locally  manufacturing  facilities  of  these  devices  in  all  provinces. Therefore, we propose to allocate Rs. 500 million for this purpose in 2025. Initially, the  assistive  device  manufacturing  facility  at  the  Rheumatology  and Rehabilitation Hospital, Ragama will be expanded as the national center and regional manufacturing centers will be established as necessary.        

period 

by  allowing them to purchase essential food items at affordable prices as a supportive measure to reduce the increased cost of living. Accordingly, it is proposed to provide a Dry Food Ration including rice, canned fish, dhal, onions, potatoes, and dried fish at a concessionary rate through Lanka Sathosa Ltd, during the upcoming New Year season. We propose to allocate Rs. 1,000 million to finance these rations. 

## 17. Sri Lankan Expatriates

both in terms of foreign exchange remittances and skills they bring back to the homeland, following their work overseas. We are exploring ways of encouraging and rewarding this important community of Sri Lankans. As a first step, we propose to introduce a special allowance for returning migrant workers as they return to the country. The criteria and basis for the allowance will be determined and publicized following a detailed study of options.  

## 18. Special Interest Scheme for Senior Citizens

We propose to implement a Special Interest Scheme for Senior Citizens. Under this scheme, individuals above 60 years of age will be eligible for one-year fixed deposits of up to Rs. 1 million with an annual additional interest rate of 3 percent, above the prevailing interest rates in the market for ensuring their financial stability. To implement the scheme, we propose to allocate Rs. 15,000 million to subsidize the 3 percent additional interest to be paid for the senior citizens.  

This scheme will be implemented from July 2025.  

## 19. Creating a Drug - Free Society

Drug addiction is a significant concern in Sri Lanka, affecting various segments of society. Therefore, the Government has recognized the importance of creating a drug-free society through multifaceted approaches that go beyond punishment. Accordingly, we propose to prepare a comprehensive programme incorporating awareness campaigns, rehabilitation including counseling, social empowerment and integration, and law enforcement. Accordingly, we propose to allocate Rs. 500 million to implement a compressive program to create drug-free society. 

## 20. Skills Development Programme for Convicted Prisoners

At present, there are around 30,000 prisoners in 37 prisons located island wide. One third of them are convicted prisoners and others are remand prisoners. Overcrowding of prisons results in degraded living conditions in the prison which violates the notion that prisoners are also human beings.  

Around 65 percent of the prisoners are in the peak of their working age; below 40.  Accordingly,  we  propose  to  conduct  employable  and  marketable  skill development courses together with vocational training institutions and award relevant  vocational  qualifications.  For  this  purpose,  we  propose  to  increase existing allocation by Rs. 100 million to implement this programme.             

## 21. Public Transport Modernization

access to meaningful economic engagement and mobility.  

Therefore, it is essential to enhance existing public transport systems with new technologies  and  introduce  new  transport  modes  to  meet  the  increasing passenger demand, especially in urban and suburban areas. Accordingly, it is a timely requirement to upgrade and modernize both road and rail transportation systems. 

As an initial step towards enhancing public sector transportation, a modern and comfortable fleet of technologically advanced buses will be introduced on a pilot basis.  Accordingly,  100  air-suspension,  low-floor,  comfortable  buses  will  be deployed along three main road corridors within Colombo city. We propose to allocate Rs. 3,000 million for the procurement of 100 low floor buses. In addition to that SLTB will add 200 low-bed passenger buses for its fleet through its own funds.  

These buses will be operated under newly established companies collectively known as Metro Bus Companies (MBC). Proposed bus companies will operate on a fully digitized platform.  

Rail based public transportation is highly important in long distance as well as the urban and sub-urban areas. However, the poor condition of the coaches negatively impacts passenger safety, comfort, and train speed. Further, it is important to establish  the railway system as an industry while focusing on repairing and building new coaches within the country.  

Accordingly, as a first step, we propose to allocate Rs. 500 million to rehabilitate old railway passenger coaches targeting to rehabilitate passenger coaches to enhance the efficiency of services and cater the growing passenger demand. 

We propose to allocate Rs. 250 million for 2025 to the Department of Railways to initiate  building  new  coaches  aiming  at  fulfilling  new  passenger  coach requirements within the country.  

In order to provide an efficient railway service and improve public transportation facilities, we propose to extend the Kelani Valley Railway Line, which currently operates up to Avissawella, beyond Avissawella in phases. An allocation of Rs. 250 million will be made through the 2025 budget to begin the initial work related to this. 

The  Government  will  implement  a  joint  time  table  in  all  bus  routes  after discussing with CTB and private bus operators. The Government will continue to invest in the Kandy multi-modal transport terminal development project which would have important spill-over effects in terms of regional development.   

 Transporting  agricultural  goods  over  the  road  network  remains  a  major challenge  due  to  high  costs,  post-harvest  loses  during  transportation,  road congestion,  and  environmental  concerns.  To  address  this,  we  propose  to introduce a dedicated rail-based transportation of agriculture products from production centers to destinations.  

We plan to upgrade the Thambuththegama Railway Station by incorporating loading docks with storage facilities upon the recommendation of the study. To support  this  initiative,  we  propose  an  allocation  of  Rs.  100  million  for  the feasibility study as the initial step. 

SriLankan Airlines (SLA) performs a leading service in the transportation of passengers and cargo by air. Furthermore, previous Governments' attempts to divest  state  ownership  and  attract  private  investment  have  also  been unsuccessful. 

In light of this, the Government would sign an agreement with those banks and set aside Rs. 10,000 million for loan capital repayment in 2025 as well as Rs. 10,000 million for interest payments. The Airline would be fully responsible for ensuring operating profitability once these legacy debt service costs are settled by the Government. A new medium term strategic plan is being devised by the company towards this end. Accordingly, we propose to allocate Rs. 20,000 million for this purpose.  

A robust road network is a critical component of the infrastructure necessary to connect citizens with markets and public spaces.  

As such, we propose an allocation of Rs. 3,000 million for improvement and rehabilitation of rural roads, giving priority to roads that connect less developed rural villages, tourist destinations, industrial estates and economically significant places/areas in addition to the already allocated amount of Rs. 26,680 million for the development of the rural roads island wide.   

Aiming at ensure safe and reliable mobility to all users, we propose Rs.1,000 million allocation to rehabilitation of rural bridges in addition to the already allocated amount of Rs 1,000 million for the development of the rural bridges island wide. 

It has been observed that the Northern province has been largely isolated from mainstream development. However, it holds tremendous potential to contribute significantly to our economy. As such, focusing at the rehabilitation of basic infrastructure needs, we propose to allocate Rs. 5,000 million for the rehabilitation and improvement of rural roads and bridges in the Northern Province. 

The Vadduvakal causeway is a narrow bridge over the mouth of the Nandikadal lagoon  in  Mullaitivu,  which  is  the  main  artery  connecting  Mullaitivu, Pudukkudiyiruppu, and Jaffna. This bridge is in a dilapidated condition which creates risks to commuters. Therefore, we propose to build  Vadduvakal bridge aligned with the developmental needs of the Mullaitivu District. We propose to allocate Rs. 1,000 million under this budget to commence work accordingly. 

## 22. Regional Development

The Decentralize Budget Programme 2025 is being implemented focusing on building a production economy. For this purpose, we propose that each MP is to be allocated Rs. 10 million for 2025 utilizing Rs. 2,250 million from the already allocated budgetary provisions of Rs. 11,250 million to minimize the regional disparities. The remaining Rs. 9,000 million will be allocated for the essential development activities.  

## 23. District Development Programme

As we understand, there are unanswered issues in many districts in spite of the huge investment made by the Government annually through the budget on various  programmes.  The  particular  issues  may  be  related  to  infrastructure development, enhancing localized production, effective service delivery, trade and marketing, institutional improvements etc. In order to reach at an inclusive and sustainable development, those untouched gaps and emerging needs in districts are required to be addressed. This will catalyse the private sector to bring investment for economic development and also will enable the local community to enhance their decent living. In this context, we propose to allocate Rs. 2,000 million in the budget 2025 to address these emerging issues at district level. 

## 24. Eastern Province Development

Eastern Province is one of the provinces with a huge potential for economic development.  Therefore,  we  propose  to  implement  a  comprehensive development programme in the Eastern Province with the Indian Multi-sectoral Grant Assistance to support infrastructure and livelihood development, focusing mainly  on  education,  health,  agriculture,  fisheries,  tourism  and  community empowerment sectors. 

## 25. Programmes to Uplift the Living Standards of Malayagam Tamil People

The Malayagam people are a part of the Sri Lankan nation and have been living with significant difficulties over a long period of time. However, the livelihoods of  this  community  still  remain  below  standards  to  have  a  dignified  life. Accordingly, Rs. 7,583 million has already been allocated to support the following initiatives.   

i.  Rs.  4,267  million  is  allocated  for  development  of  estate  housing  and infrastructure development.  

ii.  Rs.  2,450  million  is  allocated  for  Vocational  training,  Livelihood development and Infrastructure Development of Malayagam Tamil youth 

iii. Rs. 866 million is allocated for smart class rooms for schools in Malayagam Tamil community. 

## 26. Industrial Development

The  industrial  sector  in  Sri  Lanka  plays  a  crucial  role  in  its  economy predominantly  in  providing  employment  opportunities,  increasing  income, fostering innovation, and driving exports. Accordingly, the following proposals are to be introduced. 

resources and providing essential industrial inputs for domestic manufacturing, it is proposed to establish an Industrial Estate in Paranthan, Northern Province dedicated for chemical product manufacturing including acids and alkalis. There will  be  5  Industrial  parks  such  as  KKS,  Maankulam,  Iranawila,  Galle  and Tincomalee. We propose to allocate Rs. 500 million for this purpose.  

manufacturing 

A significant level of investment in the domestically value-added automobile manufacturing/assembly  industry  and  rubber  product  manufacturing  is  an important  factor  to  cater  to  the  demand  required  by  the  components manufacturing industry to become competitive in the export market.  

With this purpose, it is proposed to establish an Industrial Estate dedicated for Automobile components and rubber manufacturing. We propose to manage the requirement for this purpose within the already allocated budgetary provisions of Rs. 1,500 million under the Ministry of Industry for this purpose.  

## 27. Clean Sri Lanka

The Clean Sri Lanka Program is a massive program implemented through the three main pillars of social development, environmental development and ethical development to sustainably elevate Sri Lanka and the entire Sri Lankan society to a  higher  level.  For  this,  the  entire  public,  the  state  sector,  entrepreneurs, businessmen  including  the  private  sector,  national  and  international  non-governmental organizations, the Sri Lankan community abroad, international donor  agencies,  various  professionals  and  experts,  are  being  planned  and implemented with the support of all. 

Under this, It is expected to conduct a cultural festival where all sections of the community can enjoy together promoting inter-ethnic, inter-religious and inter-communal ties in Sri Lankan society, mutual understanding and cooperation,  

create facilities for the differently-abled people of our country which constitute a significant percentage of the population, promote the ethics and capacity building of facilitators such as three-wheelers, taxi drivers and tour guides for the tourism industry, renovate several selected cities with ancient heritage with their ancient identity,  renovating  buildings,  repairing  school  equipment  and  improving sanitation facilities for selected provincial schools with less facilities, building a high-quality learning environment with the participation of the private sector for early childhood development, promoting sanitation facilities in urban areas, promoting  road  safety,  drug  prevention,  managing  stray  animals,  assisting relevant agencies on managing solid waste, making the coastline attractive and environmentally  sustainable,  carry  out  conservation  of  watersheds  and promotion of water quality in rivers, making public service efficient, creating high resource utilization and building a corruption free public service and promotion and dissemination of the Clean Sri Lanka concept. 

For this, we propose to allocate Rs. 5,000 million from the state budget for the year 2025 in addition to the financial contribution of the donors.        

## 28. Solid Waste Management

There is a growing issue of solid waste management in many areas of the country. Anuradhapura, a city with significant historical and cultural value, is one such example. With the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital and a growing population, managing both general and hospital waste has become a challenge, threatening public health and the environment. To tackle this, we propose to allocate Rs. 750 million for a waste disposal facility. This initiative will improve cleanliness, protect  the  environment,  and  promote  sustainable  development  in Anuradhapura municipal area. 

## 29. Mitigating Elephant-Human Conflict and Conservation of Forests

To minimize crop damage, property destruction, and loss of life caused by wild elephants,  several  measures  have  been  implemented.  These  include  the improvement  of  approximately  5,611  km  of  electric  fencing,  with  1,456  km identified for refurbishment. Additionally, guard posts along the fence will be constructed, necessary equipment will be procured, and elephant habitats will be improved through invasive plant removal, better grassland management, and enhanced water sources. A budget of Rs. 300 million has been allocated for these efforts. 

Furthermore, Rs. 100 million has been allocated to enhance the capacity of 270 offices, including wildlife zonal offices, guard offices, and Bittu officers. These funds will support electric fence maintenance, vehicle and boat maintenance, wildlife crime prevention, and overall efforts to reduce the human-elephant conflict. An additional Rs. 240 million has been allocated as compensation for victims of such conflicts, bringing the total budget for mitigating the elephant-human conflict to Rs. 640 million. 

Moreover, Rs. 1,050 million has been allocated to promote natural regeneration and address deforestation. This funding will support reforestation efforts, forest conservation  initiatives,  commercial  forestry  expansion,  environmental protection,  and  mangrove  management.  It  will  also  facilitate  eco-friendly tourism, increase forest cover, minimize forest fires, and prevent forest-related crimes. 

## 30. Sustainable Financing

The Government will leverage opportunities in sustainable financing to foster a vibrant  ecosystem  of  Environmental  Social  and  Governance  (ESG)  based financing.  The Ministry of Environment will work in coordination with the Ministry  of Finance  and  Central  Bank,  to access  globally  available  pools  of sustainable financing linked to climate change initiatives and related endeavours. 

## 31. Developing Financial Markets

As  Sri  Lanka  emerges  from  the  economic  crisis,  the  financial  sector  is  also recovering from a period of stress. It is not appropriate to focus on developing the financial market of the country in order to position them to support growth of the real economy. Capital markets need to be deepened and evolved in terms of  sophistication.  The  government  will  actively  encourage  private  and appropriate state entities to raise funds through listed equity and debt capital markets.  

As  bank  interest  rates  decline,  it  becomes  all  the  more  important  for  retail investors to have access to  well-regulated financial products that provide a reasonable return. Unit Trusts, investment funds, and other collective investment schemes will be important in filling this gap in the market. It is important for the sector to explore innovations and more complex transitions whilst ensuring due diligence  and  all  necessary  safeguards,  amidst  an  effective  regulatory environment. 

## 32. Governance Reforms

Corruption has been identified as a major impediment to economic progress. Hence, there is an urgent need in addressing the rampant corruption that hinders the country's sustainable economic development as a collective effort. In this context, it is not only the Government officials but also the private actors and the entire citizenry should acknowledge their role in perpetuating corruption. In this regard,  the  necessary  legal  framework  will  be  strengthened  further.  The enactment  of  the  Proceeds  of  Crime  bill  and  further  strengthening  of  the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption (CIABOC) will be expedited with the increased financial and other support with the assistance of  the  international  institutions  to  drive  anti-corruption  initiatives  towards strengthening  governance,  transparency  and  accountability  in  Sri  Lanka. Moreover,  the  Government  will  review  and  implement  Proceeds  of  Crime legislation which is now in draft stage following a collaborative drafting process.  

## 33. Sri Lanka Day

articulates  a  vision  for  a  reconciled  Sri  Lanka,  committed  to  bridging  gaps which we have the highest number of tourist arrivals to our country. This festival will be organized with the participation of the private sector. Accordingly, we propose to allocate Rs. 300 million for this purpose. 

## 34. Housing for Internally Displaced People

With the reconciliation initiatives and release of lands, the internally displaced people (IDPs) are being resettled and refugees are returning to the Northern and Eastern  Provinces  for  resettlement  after  the  conflict.  However,  the  basic infrastructure facilities and utilities of the resettle families are yet to be fulfilled.  

Accordingly, we propose to initiate a multi-pronged strategy to address the key issues faced by people in the North and the East. In the 2025 Budget, Rs.1,500 million has been allocated to meet the needs of resettling these people and speed up the housing programme and provide essential relief to the families remaining homeless based on the current requirement.  

## 35. Essential Maintenance of Housing Schemes Constructed by Government

The  physical  condition  of  the  public  housing  schemes  provided  by  the Government has been poor due to lack of maintenance and deficiencies in usage. Many physical defects such as cracking, spalling, corrosion and water seepage were observed at the external side of all these buildings.  Accordingly, we propose to allocate Rs. 1,000 million for essential maintenance of the apartment complexes constructed by the Central Government. 

## 36. Housing for Artists/Journalists

housing  units  are  being  constructed.  Within  this,  an  apartment  complex comprising 108 housing units will be reserved from the Kottawa, Palathuruwatta area for artists and journalists who make special contributions to the cultural enrichment of our society.  

## 37. Drinking Water Sector

community water projects

The pipe-borne drinking water coverage by the National Water Supply and Drainage Board and the Community Water Supply Department, is around 62 percent of the country's population. Identifying the national importance of ensuring safe water delivery, the Government has committed to provide budgetary support to expedite the completion of Gampaha, Attanagalle, and Minuwangoda integrated water supply project, Aluthgama, Mathugama and Agalawatta  integrated  water  supply  project,  Polgahawela,  Allawwa  and Pothuhara integrated water supply project and Thabutthegama water supply project where the completion has been delayed due to the economic crisis and the suspension of credit facilities by the respective lenders. The Government will provide the funding requirement of Rs. 41,234 million in a span of two years with available fiscal space.  Accordingly, Rs. 20,000 million is included in the national budget for the year 2025 to facilitate the completion of the 

We have realized the necessity of implementing the community-based water supply  schemes  specifically  in  rural  areas  where  the  pipe-borne  water coverage  is  limited.  To  enhance  the  quality  of  rural  life  by  eradicating vulnerabilities in water stressed areas, including the Northern region and CKDu  affected  areas,  we  recognize  the  importance  of  extending  the community-based rural water supply schemes in such areas to deliver fully treated drinking water.  

Accordingly, we propose to utilize the already allocated Rs 2,000 million in the budget estimates under the Department of Community Water Supply for the year 2025 to complete the community water supply schemes which have already  been  started  and  to  commence  new  community  water  supply schemes.  

Giribawa and Eppawala areas being in a dry zone under North Central province face difficulties in terms of access to quality drinking water, creating various risks to the population of that region. We recognize the importance of providing drinking water from surface water sources to the area of Giribawa and Eppawala preferably by Rajanganaya Tank which is fed by Kalawewa through Kala Oya. For this purpose, we proposed to allocate Rs. 1,000 million for re- initiating of initial works in Giribawa- Eppawala Water Supply Scheme to provide pipe-borne water to the area.      

## 38. Filling Essential Vacancies in the Public Service

We have stopped the past practice of filling the public service with the supporters and transfers in the public service will be based on qualifications and skills, free from political influence. 

Due to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, economic downturn, and political instability, there is a large number of unemployed graduates and youth. We will implement a strategic recruitment plan to hire 30,000 individuals in essential public service roles, strictly according to cadre vacancies starting from this year. Accordingly, we propose to allocate Rs 10,000 million for this purpose in 2025. 

## 39. Public Service Salary Increase

Given that nearly a decade has passed since the last basic salary revision, it is now time to revise the salary structure having evaluated all factors in a holistic manner. It is necessary to provide a decent living standard for public sector employees, enabling the Government to attract talent and skilled workers, whilst at the same time avoiding an excessive burden on the budget.  

Accordingly, we propose to increase the minimum monthly basic salary from Rs.24,250 to Rs.40,000 by Rs.15,750. The current ad-hoc interim allowance and special allowance will be integrated into the basic salary giving a net increase of Rs.8,250 in the minimum salary. 

The proposed minimum monthly basic salary increase of Rs. 15,750 will also be applicable to judicial services, public corporations, statutory boards, university staff, and officers of tri-forces on the same basis in line with the minimum basic salary increase for public sector employees. 

In  addition  to  a  minimum  monthly  basic  salary  increase  of  Rs.15,750,  it  is proposed  to  raise  the  value  of  the  annual  salary  increment  by   80  percent. Consequently, the minimum annual salary increment of Rs. 250 will be increased to Rs. 450. It is also proposed to adjust annual salary increments for all public sector employees to the same percentage. 

The total estimated cost of this salary increase is expected to be Rs.325 billion. Considering present fiscal constraints, it is proposed that this salary increase be implemented in phases. Of the total net salary increase, Rs.5,000 and 30 percent of the balance amount will be paid starting from April 2025, with the remaining 70 percent being paid in equal portions beginning in January 2026 and January 2027. 

Therefore, it is proposed that Rs.110 billion be allocated for the proposed salary increase in 2025.  

As part of this salary increase, it is proposed that the retirement benefits for officers retiring on or after 01.01. 2025 be calculated based on the new salary structure, ensuring that they receive retirement benefits under the proposed 2025 salary scheme. 

Considering the increase in the minimum basic salary of state employees, the limit on distress loans for public servants which is currently set at Rs. 250,000 will also be increased to Rs. 400,000. Further details of the salary increase are given in the Technical Note in Annexure V.      

## 40. Private Sector Minimum Wage Increase

The  Employers'  Associations  have  already  agreed  to  increase  the  monthly Minimum Wage to the Private Sector workers from Rs. 21,000 to Rs. 27,000 in April 2025 and to Rs. 30,000 from 2026.  

## 41. Reconsideration of the Wage of Plantation Workers

There are nearly 1.5 million plantation workers engaged in the sector, mainly in tea, rubber and coconut. The Government is of the view that their living standards need to be improved. In addition to the programmes focused on the development of plantation sector, the Government will intervene to increase the daily wages of the workers to Rs. 1,700. 

## 42. Public Sector Pensions

Further, by considering salaries and benefits entitled to them, a monthly increase of Rs. 3,000 was implemented immediately after the Presidential election thus resolving the Pension Anomalies of Pensioners who retired before 01st January 2016. 

We observe that there will be a pension anomaly created by revising the pensions of the Government employees who retired from 2016 - 2020 only, based on the salary scale of the fifth phase related to the year 2020, since all the pensioners who retired till 31.12.2017 are on the same salary scale. 

As this issue remains unresolved for a long time, we believe that it has to be resolved in a phased manner within the existing limited fiscal space. Therefore, we propose to revise the pensions of all pensioners who retired before 01.01.2020 in three phases, corresponding to the salary scales applicable to the year 2020 as per the Public Administration Circular No. 03/2016.      

As the first phase, the pensions of all pensioners who retired before 01.01.2018 will be revised in line with the third stage salary scales relevant to the year 2018 in the Public Administration Circular No. 03/2016 and to be implemented from July 2025. For this phase, we propose to allocate Rs. 10,000 million through the Budget 2025. 

Furthermore, we also propose to implement the pension conversions related to the fourth and fifth stages of the salary conversion from July 2026 and July 2027, respectively. 

## 43. Legal Reforms

The Government will introduce a number of legal reforms in the coming year to establish sound legal provisions aimed at fostering rapid economic development, good  governance,  and  effective  public  service  delivery.  These  laws  include legislation to improve governance of state owned enterprises, creating a legal framework  for  public-private  partnerships,  enhancing  governance  around procurement, public asset management, statistics, data exchange, valuation, asset management, microfinance and credit and anti-money laundering and terrorist financing.  More details on these laws are available in the Annexure VIII of the budget.       

## 44. Revenue Measures

based fiscal consolidation. This is reflective of the fact that leading up to the levels of 7.3 percent of GDP in 2022.  

For the year 2025, the bulk of revenue gains is expected to be delivered by the liberalisation of motor vehicle imports that took place on 1st February 2025. This process is being carefully monitored to ensure that import of vehicles does not result in undue negative impacts on external sector stability. Other key revenue measures  which  have  already  been  announced  in  Parliament  previously  in December 2024 include the increase of tax-free threshold for personal income tax, further adjustments to the second income tax slab, removal of VAT on fresh milk and yoghurt. The Government also decided to not pursue this year the Imputed Rental Income Tax that had been agreed by the previous administration. To compensate for any revenue losses, the Government already presented in  

Parliament measures including the introduction of VAT on digital services, the imposition of corporate income tax on export of services, and an increase in the corporate tax on cigarettes/liquor, and gaming.  

The tax policy measures outlined here are expected to deliver the required revenue to enable Sri Lanka to meet the revenue targets of 15.1 percent of GDP in 2025. Nonetheless, in parallel, the Government is taking concerted efforts to improve tax administration and compliance. In fact, Sri Lanka's revenue strategy for the upcoming budget aims to enhance fiscal sustainability by strengthening tax  administration,  improving  compliance,  improve  institutional  strength through enhanced digitalization and rigorous monitoring mechanisms; while providing relief to the most vulnerable groups of the society. Efforts will be directed  toward  digitalizing  tax  systems  to  reduce  leakages  and  enhance transparency while minimizing human interactions in tax administration.  

Sri  Lanka  is  moving  towards  a  cashless  economy  as  a  part  of  its  broader digitalization agenda to formalize the economy and improve revenue collection. The use of Point-of-Sale (POS) machines across businesses, especially in VAT-registered enterprises, will be implemented as a key initiative to facilitate digital transactions and reduce cash dependency. A cashless economy will not only curb tax  evasion  and  illicit  financial  activities  but  also  enhance  fiscal  efficiency, Digitalisation  of  revenue  agencies  and  the  overall  digital  economy  drive  is expected  to  provide  significant  impetus  to  the  revenue  enhancing  efforts. However, it is not just the tax collection authorities that have a responsibility in this regard. Several other stakeholders, including audit firms and tax accountants, have a responsibility to discharge their duties in a socially responsible manner such that the Government is not deprived of due tax revenue. Appropriate measures will be taken to ensure compliance with the regulatory and legal framework in this regard as well.    

We are confident that these tax administration and tax compliance enhancement measures will enable Sri Lanka to surpass revenue targets beyond 2025. At that point, it will be possible to provide further relief to the public in a manner that fiscal and economic stability.       

## 45. Borrowing Limit

The Borrowing Limit for the Appropriation Bill for the financial year 2025 is presented in Annexure II. In addition, the Technical Note on expenditure and revenue  measures  is  given  in  Annexure  III  and  Annexure  IV,  respectively. Further, the documents, which have to be submitted along with the Second Reading of the Budget under the Public Financial Management Act, No. 44 of 2024, are also tabled. 

## Conclusion  

While the policies that I outlined today reflect the vision upon which I was elected to this office, I did not come up with them alone. These policies are the result of an incredible effort, born out of the dedication and collective action of a Cabinet, most of whom have never served in a Parliament but have vast experience and practical knowledge. They were born from the experience of many dedicated and devoted civil servants and policymakers who finally have a voice in shaping the destiny of our country. And they were born from the confidence and courage of the many renowned, patriotic professionals who have distinguished themselves in  their  careers,  and  for  the  first  time  had  the  confidence  that  they  could contribute to a truly clean, truly functional and truly compassionate Government. 

If you look in the ranks of this Government, you will see a mix of some of the most passionate and disciplined politicians, and some of the most accomplished academics and professionals who have sacrificed their careers, time with their families  and  even  their  business  legacies  to  put their  country  before  profit. Together, we have begun a monumental effort. We have brought down costs of living. We have begun restoring confidence in our justice system. And we have for  the  first  time  banished  not  just  corruption  but  even  the  appearance  of corruption from the highest echelons of power. 

For many years now, those who felt moved to invest in Sri Lanka found that in order to get anything done, they would first have to invest in middlemen. That era  is  over.  I  can  assure  you  that  no  elected  or  appointed  official  in  this Government will seek bribes or favours in return for doing or not doing their jobs. However, in the very unlikely event that anyone among us does bend or break the law, I can promise that whoever is responsible will be investigated and prosecuted to the full extent of the law. This Government will never, ever, tolerate corruption among its ranks. From here on, those who attempt to receive bribes should be afraid.  One should not be afraid of not paying the bribe.  

Our judiciary has never been more free or independent. Our police force has never been more empowered or independent. They will enforce the law without fear or favour. However, many who have left Sri Lanka and live overseas know that elimination of corruption is about more than just enforcing the law. It is about modernizing  the  way  Government  functions,  making  the  state  machinery function more efficiently, and function more transparently. This will address the root cause of corruption by making it harder to take bribes, and less attractive to pay them.  

Never has Sri Lanka had a chance like this to catch up with the modern world. I see a chance for united Sri Lanka, for a clean Sri Lanka, for a prosperous Sri Lanka, 

To the Sri Lankan Expatriates, those with Sri Lankan roots, whether you were born in Sri Lanka or heard of your motherland from your parents, know that to us, you are all Sri Lankans. 

 Your country is proud of your success. We understand why you may have lost faith in our motherland. Know that I am grateful for every effort that any of you take, even from afar, to help our country.  

We invite you, one and all, to come back and see for yourself how much Sri Lanka has changed. We invite you to contribute your expertise, your talent and your perspective to our island nation, whether in the private, public or non-profit sectors. Join us, and work with us to accomplish a level of success that we can only all achieve together. 

Majority of our citizens voted last year to chart a new course, to unite to rebuild our country and reach the full potential of our citizenry. For the first time in history, all of Sri Lanka, from north to south, and east to west, have united behind a common purpose. Religion, race, gender, class and age no longer divide us. That is one thing I can promise about the people of Sri Lanka: The people will never again be divided against each other. The people will never again be fooled by those who seek to turn us against each other for their own political or personal gain. 

Public  Representatives  and  officials  of  our  Government  all  have  a  common objective.  Similarly  the  thousands  of  hardworking,  dedicated,  and  patriotic public servants who have joined us to make a difference also have a collective objective.  We will never tire. We will never waver. We will not compromise on our principles. We will never ever let you down. We will lead by example, and raise all Sri Lankans up together. Together we will all prosper. We will all be proud of each other and of the beautiful, sacred island we call home. 

Finally, I want to express my gratitude to the officials at the Ministry of Finance, especially the Secretary to the Treasury Mahinda Siriwardana, who  worked tirelessly for weeks to finalize the budget. I expect further cooperation from the officials at the Treasury to successfully implement the budget proposals in time to take forward the economic programme of the Government.  

Thank you!
